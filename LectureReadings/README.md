# Lecture readings

This file provide links to what I consier the minimum required reading/watching. Find and add/suggest more as required to learn the concepts:

## Week 3 (9/24 to 9/28)
 - [Kanaloa Guide for Installing RobotX Simulation](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/Tutorials/SoftwareInstallation/RobotX-Simulation)
   - Note, most of this is copied from the Robot X Simulatin creators site. As such, some of the steps are redundant if you already have a working ROS and Gazebo installation.
 - [MIT 2.12 Robotics Course Lab Notes](http://people.csail.mit.edu/peterkty/teaching/)
   - You should be able to recreate, in our simulation environments and then in the realworld robots, the trajectory exercises in Lab 2.

## Week 2 (9/17 to 9-21)

### ROS Tutorials to complete: 

 - [Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Python)](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29)
