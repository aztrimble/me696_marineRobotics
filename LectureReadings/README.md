Readings from 2018,
## Week 3 (9/24 to 9/28)
 - [Kanaloa Guide for Installing RobotX Simulation](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/Tutorials/SoftwareInstallation/RobotX-Simulation)
   - Note, most of this is copied from the Robot X Simulation creators site. As such, some of the steps are redundant if you already have a working ROS and Gazebo installation.
 - [MIT 2.12 Robotics Course Lab Notes](http://people.csail.mit.edu/peterkty/teaching/)
   - You should be able to recreate, in our simulation environments and then in the realworld robots, the trajectory exercises in Lab 2.
